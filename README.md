# AMS
This is my side project. I wrote this in VB.NET. I wrote this to get myself up to speed on VB.NET. I call my desktop application Academic Management System. This connects to a Microsoft SQL Server database.
The master branch is version 1.0. The various functionalities of this application are the ability to add teachers, students, and courses into the database, update the entities information, register students with their respective classes, run predefined reports, and look up a studentâ€™s grades. 

In the FeatureLogin Branch: I'm developing a log in screen requiring a user to log in before using the application.
