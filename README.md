This is my side project. I wrote this in VB.NET. I wrote this to get myself up to speed on VB.NET. I call my desktop application Academic Management System. This connects to a Microsoft SQL Server database.
The master branch is version 1.0. The various functionalities of this application are the ability to add teachers, students, and courses into the database, update the entities information, register students with their respective classes, run predefined reports, and look up a studentâ€™s grades. 

Next Updates that are coming:

add course teacher info, 
update student,teacher info
course register   - make all fields in these forms mandatory when registering/updating 

include create user page, and add password hashing and salting
